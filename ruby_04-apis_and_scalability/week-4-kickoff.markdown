# Scale Up - An Overview

During Weeks 4 & 5, the class will split into teams.

Today we'll talk about the options and give you a survey to select your first and second choice options for what you'd like to work on.

On **Friday of Week 4**, we'll evaluate your progress and decide together if you should continue working or move to a different project for Week 5.

Each project has it's own set of weekend research/pre-work - but should not exceed 1 to 3 hours.

# Your Next Steps

  - Read the descriptions and fine print below
  - Complete [This Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfX6a1kQYcQXVZMluwyl2unpk9-cJFT1ypF-p70W4Sj0T0hng/viewform) no later than ***2pm Friday***
  - Once you are assigned a working group, you'll receive relevant pre-work to be completed no later than ***9am Monday***

# Learning Goals

You should have the following things at the end of this project:

1. Gotten two weeks of project development in an agile workflow.
2. Have a solid example of your ability as a Turing grad to **learn in a self directed way** and **commit to a codebase in a professional way**.

# Basic Team Descriptions

### LookingFor (Boxtrot)

- **What You’ll Do:** Work like a consulting team picking up stories on an existing open source project that scrapes job listings and puts together a searchable database of job postings, historical data on what companies have been hiring for, and what technologies are most requested in job postings.

- [Rails app](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor) that's been built out by module 4 over the last four classes. The application collects information on job postings relevant to Turing students.

- [React Front End](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd) that has existed for two cohorts that is meant to replace the front end for the rails application and give a better browsing experience. Also a good place to get experience in what React does!

### MentorSHIP

- **What You’ll Do:** Work like a consulting team picking up stories on an existing open source project. Last module, a team worked to evaluate an existing, out of date [rails application](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/mentorSHIP), cut scope and do a rebuild in a JavaScript. The existing application was built for connecting and working with Mentors at Turing.

- There is a [Rails 5 API](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-API), an [Ember.js Front End](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-FrontEnd) and [copious documentation](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP/MentorSHIP-documentation) on the next steps and how to jump in to the project.

### Whiskey Tango

  -  **What You’ll Do:** Work on an Independent Study project, report progress in daily standup.
  -  **Good Option For:** Folks who have a passion project and feel they can stay motivated during a week or two.
  -  **Special Notes:** To do an independent study, you will need to get the idea approved by instructors.

Whiskey Tango proposals that are typically accepted by instructors have the following characteristics: ***they build off of an existing project and add value to it*** or ***they research a new technology in a way that can be feasibly done and shown in a portfolio in a short period of time***

Examples of past independent studies include:
 - Steve Olson: Built a [React Native IOS app](https://github.com/SteveOscar/Ramble_App) that displays the currency and expense data generated by his Ramble Map project.
 - Brant Wellman: De-coupled the basic 3D Engine code of his and Aaron's Gametime project from the actual gameplay code and published it into it's [own repo](https://github.com/brantwellman/3D-graphics-engine) with an in-depth companion [blog post](http://www.co-de-pendency.com/creating-a-3d-engine-the-setup-and-rendering-points/).
 - Claudia: Worked on cleanup and user requested features for her personal project [TexArc](https://github.com/Claudia108/TexArch), which is an online tool hosting data supportive to archaeological research of Sergio Ayala at Gault School of Archaeological Research in San Marcos, TX
 - Chad Ellison: Rebuild a small rails app of [Texas Holdem](https://github.com/chadellison/texas_holdem) using Rails 5 and Action Cable. 

# The Fine Print

You'll be expected to follow the following workflow:
  - Track your hours and aim to complete 8 working hours per work day (times are flexible).
  - Attend team stand up daily or let your team know if you need to skip and provide a detailed stand up message
  - Write about your experience in a blog post
  - Actively participate in the PR process - i.e. monitor and comment on PRs that your team members submit, respond to PR reviews from teammates, instructors and mentors.

Self study and classes that you attend count towards your 8 daily hours (as long as it is relevant to the work you're doing).

All classes the next two weeks will be optional unless otherwise stated, depending on the team you choose.
